# Benchmarking on Raspberry Pi

We have a number Raspberry Pi 3 Model B lying around.

_Hypothesis:_ Benchmarking on an array of Raspberry Pi's is "close enough" to
benchmarking on an array of real devices.

Here is some information about their CPUs:

  model name  : ARMv7 Processor rev 4 (v7l)
  ...
  Features  : half thumb fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3 tls vfpv4 idiva idivt vfpd32 lpae evtstrm crc32
  ...
  Hardware  : BCM2709
